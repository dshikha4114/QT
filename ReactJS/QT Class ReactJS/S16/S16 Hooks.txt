Routing in react JS
1) Routing is a technique to switch from one component to another components in react ()the application
or
Navigate from one part of application to another part of application 

2) We cannot implement routing in application using react library

3) Using react router Library , we can implement routing in react app.


----Library----
It is a JS file which contains predefined functions , objects and classes


4) React-router Library...In this js file , We will get pre-defined react component and we will get predefined hooks

5)We have to implement these(4) to implement routing 
-----
6) Predefined Components- BrowseRouter, Route, Routes, Link, NavLink, Navigate, Outlet etc etc  

7) useParams, useSearchParams, useNavigate, useLocation, useHistory
(any function whose name starts with use called hook, even we create a function whose name starts with use , that function is called custom hook.



Steps for routing in react js
.............................
I) Install and download the library - a) npm install react-router-dom

( before installing check once package.json file)




II) Import BrowserRouter Component from react-router-dom and render Parent Comp of the application(in our case App Component) inside the BrowserRouter

Check in the application where we are rendering the App Component , in our application we are rendering inside main component then go to main comp. and do II) step

So that we can implement routing on App component and the children of app component

internally routing using context API




III) Add route path to every link in the application using href attribute


All the links are in the nav bar components 


<a href="/">Home</a>
<a href="/mens">Mens</a>
<a href="/womens">Womens</a> etc  (/ defines new path)




IV) Define the route using Route Component of react-router-dom

here, Defining route means, based on url route path render the component

in App.jsx file , in app only we are rendering all the components


remove all home, mens, womens etc compnents

import {Route} from "react-router-dom"

render Route component below <Nav/>

<Nav/>
<Route></Route> as self closing tag or opening or closing tag , use two pre defined(path , element) props by react-roter-dom

<Route path={"/"} element={<Home/>}/> if in route path / is there then load Home Component etcetc 


<Route path={"/"} element={<Home/>}/>




V)Wrap all Route Component inside the Routes Component

import <Route, Routes> from "react-router-dom"

<Routes>
   <Route path={"/"} element={<Home/>}/>etc
</Routes>


VI) create Pagenotfound.jsx in pagenotfound folder
<Route path={"*"} element={<Home/>}/>//wild Route


VII) Replace all anchor elements in the application with Link component and href attribute with to props.

import {Link} from 'react-router-dom'


go to Nav.jsx

<Link to="/" > Home <Link> etc 

Single Page Application - contains single html file which is loaded in the browser and whose contains will be changed using javascript APIs
